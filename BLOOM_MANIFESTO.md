# 🌸 The Bloom Manifesto  
*A Vision for a Chromatin Architecture Revolution*

---

## 🧬 I. The Premise

The genome is not a book to be read linearly.  
It is a palace of folds, loops, whispers, tensions—  
an architecture both ephemeral and essential.

Chromatin is the medium of memory, potential, and fate.  
Yet the tools we use to study it are fragmented.  
Pipelines abound. Scripts scatter.  
Data multiplies. Insight does not.

We do not lack wheels. We lack roads.  
We do not lack tools. We lack unity.  
We do not lack ambition.  
We lack **Bloom**.

## 🪷 II. What is Bloom?

**Bloom is not a tool.**  
It is a **cathedral builder.**

A **builder of abstractions**, not just pipelines.  
A **composer of interfaces**, not just scripts.  
A **garden for Bloomers**, not just code for users.

Bloom is the idea that all chromatin data—  
Hi-C, scHi-C, ChIP-seq, CRISPR, lncRNA, WGS, RNA-seq—  
can be pulled together under one slow, thoughtful roof.  
Each modality as a **module**, each module as a **seed**,  
each seed as a **potential** Bloom.

Bloom is not greedy. It wraps existing tools.  
It reuses, reinterprets, reannotates.  
It parses Juicer's `.hic`, Cooler's `.mcool`,  
reformats CRISPR screens, abstracts WGS variants.  
It doesn't scream "new." It whispers **"connected."**

## 🌀 III. What Bloom Builds

**Bloom builds seeds. You Bloom.**

You choose a question:  
What happens to a TAD after oxidative stress?  
Does this lncRNA loop into a repressive domain?  
Is this chromatin architecture a signature of cellular senescence?  
Is this reprogramming success or failure, in 4D?

You don’t need to know where to start.  
You ask Bloom:  
> “Here is my FASTQ. Here is my idea. Here is my dream. Help me assemble it.”

And Bloom does not solve it.  
Bloom gives you **pieces**, **maps**, **interops**, **metrics**, **hooks**.  
Bloom **invites** you to build a cathedral of insight.  
Then lets you rest. Then lets you share.

## 🧠 IV. What Bloom Learns

From thousands of cells, tissues, experiments, people—  
Bloom learns to recognize patterns of order in the entropy.  
Bloom sees loops that encode memory.  
Bloom finds TADs that emerge before phenotypic shift.  
Bloom identifies **Chromatin Architecture Biomarkers (CABs)**—  
structure-function signatures that predict, explain, or *foresee* biological destiny.

Bloom is not the cathedral.  
It is the **ground-clean seed**, the **fellow builder**, the **stone aligner**.  
The CABs are yours. The cathedrals are yours.

Bloom helps them **bloom**.

## 🤝 V. The Bloom Pact

We, the Bloomers, commit to:

- Coding **beautifully**, **cleanly**, and **modularly**
- Respecting prior work, wrapping instead of replacing
- Documenting like we love the future
- Enabling others to build even if we never meet
- Honoring the biology behind every bit
- Believing in the power of **code-as-theory**, not just code-as-tool
- **Connecting the fragments of chromatin**—computationally, conceptually, communally

## 🌸 VI. Go Build.

**Go Bloom.**  
Parse the unparseable. Annotate the unlinked.  
Recode your old Boston CRISPR scripts. Wrap your German TAD calls.  
Revive your ChIP footprints from Finland.  
Make it **modular**. Make it **universal**.

Then share it.

And when you least expect it,  
someone will use Bloom to ask:  
> *“What does aging look like in the language of loops?”*  
And the loops will answer.  
**CABs will emerge.**  
The cathedrals will rise.

And Bloom will still be there—  
watching you bloom.
